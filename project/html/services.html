        <div class="service-info">
            <p>
                Tartu has an efficient public bus network, operated by Tartu Linnatransport, covering the city and
                nearby areas. Passenger transport on a single day is provided by approximately 1,900 buses, trams,
                trolleybuses, metro, and suburban railway trains, totaling more than 43 thousand departures. There are
                15 bus routes in the city. Since 2019, Tartu’s public transport has been run by AS GoBus. A total of 64
                new buses, manufactured in the Scania factory, travel along the routes, equipped with air conditioning,
                low floors, and running on environmentally friendly fuel. There are two types of buses: normal buses (12
                m in length, 27 seats, and standing room for 52) and articulated buses (18 m in length, 41 seats, and
                standing room for 96). In addition, you can also travel with the public bike-sharing service.
